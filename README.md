# ECE143_project

Phase 1 (Data Analysis, Querrying):
- 1. Data selection:
    - 1.2 Selected datasets:<br>
        - goodreads
        - Amazon 
        -
        -
       
       
2. Datasets preprocessing
   2.1 Importing, changing column names to more readable names, omitting unwanted columns.
   2.2 Omitting or substituting null values in the datasets
   
3. Doing some querries on the indivial datasets (because the merged ones would have much lower number of rows) (*data analysis*)  
     
4. Datasets aggregation
  3.1 merging the datasets together for deriving more information
  3.2 Doing queries on the aggregated data (*data analysis*)
    3.2.1 Exploring  the current Juperter notebooks in Kaggle and searching for interesting queries and analysis they have done. List them in the following:
      - 
      -
      -
      -
     
     
Phase 2 (Book recommendation)

4. Finding a dataset which contain the pair (user, book) to know what books have been read and liked by a single user
5. Creating a recommender system


Phase 3 (Creating an interactive app/surface/website)

6. Create a well-written description about the project and add the interactive parts, plots, etc to the desired platform. Website, etc.


Phase 4 (Finalization and preparation for presentation)

7. Observing the code and the whole project for potential fault detection and improvements
8. Creating slides for presentation
9. Recording a presentation (should be sumbitted at least one week before the deadline for getting feedbacks from Professor and TAs. )
