1. Data selection:
    - 1.2 Selected datasets:<br>
        Sam, Yong and Fatemeh
        - books_10k  (requires link and description)<br>
        - book_data.csv  (requires link and description)
        <br>
        Anirudh and Zhenwei<br>
        - final_dataset.csv <br>
        - goodreads_books.csv (requires link and description)<br>
        <br>
       
2. Datasets preprocessing
    - 2.1 Importing, changing column names to more readable names, omitting unwanted columns.
    - 2.2 Omitting or substituting null values in the datasets
    
   
3. Doing some querries on the indivial datasets (because the merged ones would have much lower number of rows) (*data analysis*)  
     
4. Datasets aggregation
    - 4.1 merging the datasets together for deriving more information
    - 4.2 Doing queries on the aggregated data (*data analysis*)
        - 4.2.1 Exploring  the current Juperter notebooks in Kaggle and searching for interesting queries and analysis they have done. List them in the following:
            - Creating a bag of words from "genres" | "best authors like those who has sold the most" [a sample can be found here]: (https://www.kaggle.com/pierpaolo28/machine-learning-visualization-4)
            - 
            - 
            - 
     
     
     
**Phase 2 (Book recommendation)** (Feb 14- Feb 20)

[One relevant notebook] (https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/what-should-you-read-next-book-recommender)
[Another relevant notebook] (https://www.kaggle.com/snanilim/book-recommendation-engine)



Further improvement (Feb 21 - Feb 27)
**Phase 3 (Creating an interactive app/surface/website)** 

7. Create a well-written description about the project and add the interactive parts, plots, etc to the desired platform. Website, etc.




**Phase 4 (Finalization and preparation for presentation)** (Feb 28- March 6)

8. Observing the code and the whole project for potential fault detection and improvements (Feb 28-Feb 29)
9. Creating slides for presentation 
10. Recording a presentation (should be sumbitted at least one week before the deadline for getting feedbacks from Professor and TAs.)
